### What I learned

```css
:root {
    --hd1: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
    --col2: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --back: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}

.calling-variables{
  color: var(--back);
}
```

While designing of this page I got to learn on how to declare variables in css which was pretty cool. This came in handy when i was assigning color values to multiple items. 

I also got to work with google fonts . Used the import method to add family font to the webpage. Checkout below:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap');

*{
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

Going forward I want to expand knowledge on bootstrap to build more complex designs.


### Useful resources

- [Code Snippet 1](Lun Dev ) - This helped me for learning variables in css pretty clear and shortens our css code. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
